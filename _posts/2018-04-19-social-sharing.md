title: Social Sharing
---

There’s a simple, clean, JavaScript-less way to add social sharing links to your site: both Twitter and Facebook provide url endpoints you can use without having to load their widgets.

* [Twitter’s Web Intent](https://dev.twitter.com/web/tweet-button/web-intent) allows you to compose a tweet from parameters.

* [Facebook’s Share Dialog](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/workplace/integrations/sharing/#sharedialogvialink) lets you set an url to be shared.

The tradeoff being the loss of the nice on-screen pop-up windows…
