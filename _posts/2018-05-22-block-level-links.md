title: Block Level Links

As cool as it is to [wrap blocks of content inside of links](https://davidwalsh.name/html5-elements-links), it does seem to come with some [accessibility drawbacks](http://www.html5accessibility.com/tests/blocklink.html).

A simple workaround to get the best of both worlds is to use the link’s `::after` pseudo element and place it on top of the entire block.

Check out the Pen [Alternative Block lvl Link](https://codepen.io/HiroAgustin/pen/VxqOGL/) to see the code.
