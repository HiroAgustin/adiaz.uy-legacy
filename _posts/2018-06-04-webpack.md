I was planning on writing a post on how to do a simple Webpack 4 setup, but while researching on how to actually do it, I found [this amazing article](https://hackernoon.com/a-tale-of-webpack-4-and-how-to-finally-configure-it-in-the-right-way-4e94c8e7e5c1) by [@riittagirl](https://twitter.com/riittagirl/) that does a much better job than I could ever do.

I created a repo [simple-webpack-setup](https://github.com/HiroAgustin/simple-webpack-setup/) and made some tweaks based on my personal preferences.
