Every other interview I’m asked to implement a `flatten` function that receives an array and returns a flattened version of it. They may request different ways to handle edge cases, but my usual answer is in the lines of…

```js
function flatten (collection = []) {
  let result = []

  collection.forEach(item => {
    if (Array.isArray(item))
      result = result.concat(flatten(item))
    else
      result.push(item)
  })

  return result
}
```

Are there better ways to do it? [Definitely](http://underscorejs.org/docs/underscore.html#section-56), but at an early interview stage this is usually good enough.

I’m still glad this comes up more often than implementing `mergeSort`.
